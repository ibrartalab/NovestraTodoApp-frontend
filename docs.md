Todo App Project Documentation
This documentation is designed according to the requirements outlined in the Novestra Full Stack Upskilling Program ToDo App assignment and should accompany the code hosted at ibrartalab/Todo-App.

1. Objective
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate hands-on, industry-relevant skills in full-stack development by building a robust and maintainable Todo Application. It showcases mastery in modern technologies including:

Frontend: React (with Redux Toolkit, hooks, context, and react-router)

Backend: .NET Core Web API (with Clean Architecture principles)

Authentication: Auth0 or custom JWT

Testing: Automated unit tests for both backend (.NET xUnit) and frontend (Jest/React Testing Library)

2. User Stories
As a...	I want to...	So that...
User	Register and log in	My tasks are private and secure
User	Add, edit, delete tasks	I can manage my daily activities
User	Mark tasks as completed	I can track my progress
User	Filter tasks by status	I can easily find active, completed, or all tasks
User	View a dashboard of completed/pending tasks	I understand my productivity at a glance
3. Database Design
Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
Users (UserID, Username, Email, PasswordHash)

Tasks (TaskID, UserID, Title, Description, Status, CreatedAt, DueDate, CompletedAt)

Relationships:

One-to-many: Each user can have multiple tasks.

4. API Design
Authentication (Auth0/JWT Based)
POST /api/auth/register — Register user

POST /api/auth/login — Login user

POST /api/auth/logout — Logout user

Tasks
GET /api/tasks — List of tasks (with filtering query params: status, date)

POST /api/tasks — Create a new task

GET /api/tasks/{id} — Get a specific task

PUT /api/tasks/{id} — Edit a task

DELETE /api/tasks/{id} — Delete a task

Dashboard
GET /api/dashboard/summary — Task stats for dashboard view

5. Architecture Overview
Frontend (React):

Modular component structure: TodoList, TodoItem, Filter, Dashboard

CSS or Tailwind CSS for styling

Routing with react-router-dom (e.g., /login, /dashboard)

State management with Context API or Redux Toolkit

API communication via Axios

Backend (.NET Core Web API):

Follows Clean Architecture: separation of concerns for Controllers, Business Logic, Repositories

Uses Entity Framework/Core for ORM

Dependency Injection for services and repositories

Exception handling and validation

6. Testing
Frontend: Automated unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library

Rendering, state changes, event handling, and API integration (using mocking/stubbing)

Backend: Unit tests in xUnit or MSTest

Test all API endpoints, business logic, and repository/database interactions

Target 80%+ code coverage

7. Planning & Estimation
Task Breakdown and Estimates
Task	Estimated Hours
Setup React project	3
Task mgmt UI components	6
Setup routing/auth	4
Setup .NET Core API	4
DB schema + EF core	4
API endpoints	4
Authentication	2
Write tests (FE+BE)	6
Total	33
Project Plan
Use a Gantt chart to map milestones and deadlines to each task.
